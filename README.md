# How It Works
For each game, the program constructs any and all combinations of the characters using a recursive Depth First Search algorithm.  However, for efficiency purposes, the program checks if the current partial string is the prefix of any existing words stored in a Trie data structure (consisting of 80,272 words) before calling the recursive function to extend the current partial string.  Once the program has found a valid word (by checking if it exists in the Trie) the word is added to a set of valid words found.
